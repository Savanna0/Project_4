# Project_4

## Overview
In this project, we selected a home sales dataset from Realtor.com. The dataset provided us with information on house sales for the years 2016 to 2024. Some examples of the columns in the dataset were county names, average listing price, and average square feet; just to name a few. Using the data provided, we created a model to predict home sale prices.

## Process

### Cleaning
First, we read in the dataset using pandas. Next, we started cleaning the dataset by dropping unwanted columns, columns that were outliers in the dataset, and columns with NAN values. Then, we renamed the columns for easier readability. Next, we split the year/month column, dropped the combined year/month column, and reordered the columns. Finally, we exported the cleaned data into a (...) to use in the house sales model training.
